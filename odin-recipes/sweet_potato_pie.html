    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet potato desserts are absolutely amazing and I love swapping out
      traditional pumpkin with sweet potato. Sweet potato pie seems to be more
      popular in the south; however, my northern family members have definitely
      been converted after eating this pie! This particular Sweet Potato Pie
      recipe is one that has been perfected over the years to get the spices
      just right. In addition, I've also started making it easier by microwaving
      the sweet potatoes rather than boiling or baking them. Also, if you enjoy
      pumpkin pie then you will certainly enjoy this pie since the texture and
      spices are similar. If you are looking for that flavorful dessert to
      impress your guests this year, then you need to make this Sweet Potato Pie
      recipe.
