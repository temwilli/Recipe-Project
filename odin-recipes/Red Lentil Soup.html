    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>To make the chickpeas</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 ºF. In a large mixing bowl add the chickpeas,
        curry paste, oil, soy sauce, and salt. Toss to coat. Spread in an even
        layer on a parchment lined baking tray and bake for 30 minutes, stirring
        every 10 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To make the soup</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the oil and onion,
        and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft
        and lightly golden. Add the garlic, chili, and curry paste and fry for 1
        minute, stirring almost constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red lentils and cauliflower and stir to coat in the curry paste.
        Add the vegetable broth and soy sauce and bring to a boil over high
        heat. Once boiling, turn the heat to low and maintain a simmer,
        partially covered, for around 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower and
        lentils are soft. Turn off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, blend until fairly
        smooth. Return to the pot if using a regular blender. Add the coconut
        milk, salt, and lime juice and turn the heat on low until warm. Taste
        and adjust salt and lime juice as needed. Turn off heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To serve</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Ladle soup into bowls and top with the chickpea croutons. Optionally you
        can garnish with minced chives and/or minced chilies. A drizzle of chili
        oil or chive oil (see note) would be nice as well.
      </li>
    </ol>
