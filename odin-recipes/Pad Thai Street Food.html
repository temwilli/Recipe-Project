    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Pad Thai most traditionally and commonly found at street stalls, food
      courts and open air markets, is made with dried shrimp. Competition drove
      many vendors to go high end by using fresh shrimp (Pad Thai goong sod).
      This pad Thai recipe is for the older, more traditional version.

      When I was growing up, my uncle was in charge of getting everybody late
      night snacks. He would go out to the nearest all night market and come
      back with everyone's orders. Mine was always Pad Thai. The pad Thai came
      wrapped in an old newspaper page lined with a plastic sheet. They would
      put extra sugar and ground chili pepper between the newspaper and plastic
      sheet. You don't see such make-shift food wrap anymore; now it's in a foam
      box.

      <li>1/2 quartered banana flower</li>
      <li>2 cups bean sprouts</li>
      <li>5-6 cut Chinese chives - green</li>
      <li>1/3 cup dried shrimp</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 cloves chopped garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground dried chili pepper ground pepper</li>
      <li>1 lime</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons toasted and crushed peanuts</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped preserved turnip</li>
      <li>1 chopped shallots</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tamarind paste</li>
      <li>1/2 packet Thai rice noodles</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup julienne Pressed Tofu</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak noodles in lukewarm water for 15 minutes while prepping. When it is
        ready it should be flexible but not soft. Toast peanuts in a pan until
        lightly brown, about 3 minutes on low heat. Coarsely grind peanuts with
        pestle and mortar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop garlic, shallot and preserved turnip (if it's not already chopped).
        Cut the Chinese chives tips off leaving 6 inch of the chives whole for
        garnish. Cut the rest into 1-inch pieces for cooking. Quarter banana
        flower lengthwise and immediately rub the cut with lime juice to prevent
        it from turning dark.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a wok or a large pot for easy stirring. Heat up your wok. You want
        good heat to the wok, but not necessarily extreme heat like other
        dishes. Add oil to the wok. Drop the chopped shallots and garlic in.
        Stir for half a minute then drop tofu and preserved turnip in. Let the
        tofu brown, about 1 minute. Add the drained noodles and ground dried
        chili pepper. Stir to separate the strands. If your noodles are ready,
        you will see that they will cook easily and become soft and chewy.
        However, if your noodles are still hard and inflexible, they have not
        been soaked long enough. Add more water in wok, a tablespoon at a time.
        It is not a bad idea when you make pad Thai for the first time, to have
        your noodles under-soaked. You'll have more time to correct the flavors.
        If your noodles are over-soaked, you won't be able to keep on cooking
        and stirring while making the adjustments; your noodles will turn mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the noodles are ready, add the seasonings, ground chili pepper,
        fish sauce, sugar and tamarind. Stir to mix them well. Add dried shrimp.
        Keep the noodles turning to get the seasonings in. Taste to see if you
        need more seasonings. Add them now. Remember that the noodles should
        have strong flavors because they will be diluted by egg, bean sprouts
        and Chinese chives at the end. But also remember that, it's a personal
        choice to add more sugar, fish sauce, lime or chili pepper at the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the noodles are cooked and chewy with desired seasonings, push the
        noodles aside to make room for egg. Crack and drop the egg in. Scramble
        the egg into the noodles.When the egg is cooked, add half of the bean
        sprouts (save the other half for garnish) and Chinese chives. Stir
        quickly to preserve the crunchiness of bean sprouts and green color of
        the Chinese chives. Pour the pad Thai onto a serving plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnishing: Sprinkle with ground pepper and chopped peanuts. Garnish
        with banana flower, beansprouts, Chinese chives and a wedge of lime.
        Serve with condiments: sugar, fish sauce and dried ground pepper.
